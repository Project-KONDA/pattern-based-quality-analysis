# Quality Pattern Model

This tool is a proof of concept for a model-driven approach to analyze the quality of research data.
It supports the specification of anti-patterns for data quality problems.
These anti-patterns are generic with respect to database technologies and formats.
Generic patterns can be adapted to several database technologies, resulting in several abstract patterns.
An abstract pattern can be concretisized for a domain-specific database format and concrete quality problem. 
The resulting concrete patterns can be utilized to locate quality problems in databases.
As proof of concept, this project realizes this approach for XML databases.

The approach is described in detail in the research paper "[Detecting Quality Problems in Research Data: A Model-Driven Approach](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4019095)",
which will be published in the proceedings of the conference "[MODELS2020](http://www.modelsconference.org)".
