# Quality Pattern Model

> Proove of concept for the definition of generic patterns, independent of database technology.

## About the Project

To localise data-inherent quality problems, we present a modeldriven approach to analyse the quality of research data.
It allows abstracting from the underlying database technology. 
Based on the observation that many quality problems show anti-patterns, generic analysis patterns can be formulated that are generic concerning the database format and technology. 
This pattern can be adapted to a specific database technology and concretisized for a domain-specific database format. 
The resulting concrete patterns are used to locate quality problems in specific databases.
As proof of concept, this project realises this approach for XML databases.
